> Tell me about yourself
--- I am a young graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 
--- I come from a suburb not far from Montpellier, a place where life is good and that's why I always have a smile on my face. 
--- Often contagious, it helps to create a good atmosphere with those around me. 
--- I have seen this with my friends, but especially during my summer jobs in public works, where despite my lack of skills, people appreciate me for this character,
--- in addition to the fact that I can learn and put into practice quickly. 
--- It also confirmed to me that working alone and as part of a team was the right thing for me. 
--- For financial and time reasons I have not had the opportunity to apply for internships in the computer field, 
--- I can finally afford it and I think I have the necessary conditions to join you, that is why I applied to you.
